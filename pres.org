* try / catch does not really help you with async.
* What happens when:
** http server without try / catch, sync response

** http server with try / catch, sync response

** http server without try / catch, async respons

** http server with try / catch, sync response

** express server without try / catch, sync response

Express uses default Connect errorHandler.

Connect has default errorHandler middleware that will print stack trace (unless
env is "test") 

** express server with try / catch, async response

** express server without try / catch, sync response

** express server with try / catch, async response



* TODO list of test cases
  - unhandled error (sync throw)
  - uncaught exception (async throw)
  - request that causes uncaught exception and is resent (GET to endpoint that
    async throws from a client that resends unfulfilled requests)
  - service reload / SIGHUP
  - try when no keep-alive connections exist
  - try when some keep-alive connections exist
  - check whether keep-alive clients wind down connections
